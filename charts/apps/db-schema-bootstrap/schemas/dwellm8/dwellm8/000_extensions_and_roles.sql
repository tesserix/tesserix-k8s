-- Dwellm8 — extensions, and the roles that make ADR-0001's ownership rule real.
--
-- One writer per table is a review rule until the database enforces it. Each
-- module gets a role; the API connects as dwellm8_app, which is a member of
-- all of them, and a future extracted module connects as its own role only.
